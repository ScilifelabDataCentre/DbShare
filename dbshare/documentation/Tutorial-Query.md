- An SQL query is the main way of extracting the information of
  interest from a database.
- The query page can be reached from the database page, or from the
  table rows page.
- The different parts of a SELECT query are shown. Only the
  `**SELECT**` and the `**FROM**` parts are strictly required.
- The LIMIT part is set by default to 200 result rows. This may be
  deleted or modified. However, not more than 2,000 rows will be
  returned from the server, for performance reasons.
- There is a limit to the execution (CPU) time allowed for a query.  A
  query will be aborted if it exceeds this limit.
- Currently, there is no way to query data from more than one database.
