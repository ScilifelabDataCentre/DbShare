### Download a database

- There are several database download options.
- Clicking **Download** on the database page fetches the database as its
  native SQLite3 file. This file can be uploaded again; see
  [Tutorial Create](Tutorial-Create).
- The pill (small rounded button) labeled **CSV tar.gz** produces a
  gzipped tar archive file containing the CSV files for each of the
  tables in the database.
- The pill labeled **XLSX** creates an Excel file with each table in its
  separate worksheet.

## Download a table

- A table can be downloaded as a CSV file. Use the **Download** button.
  The page allows some minor customization of the CSV file.
- Alternatively, the CSV data can be obtained directly using the
  pill at the top right labelled **CSV**.
- Use the **JSON** pill to obtain that format.
