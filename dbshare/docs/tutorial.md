### Exploring databases using DbShare

Public databases in DbShare can be explored without having an account
in the system. This tutorial uses a public database at the [SciLifeLab
instance of DbShare](https://dbshare.scilifelab.se/).

The the [demo database](https://dbshare.scilifelab.se/db/demo)
contains the following:

- A table of flower measurements for specimens of three species of iris:
  [iris_flower_measurements](https://dbshare.scilifelab.se/table/demo/iris_flower_measurements)
- A view selecting the measurements of one species from the table:
  [iris-setosa](https://dbshare.scilifelab.se/view/demo/iris-setosa)
